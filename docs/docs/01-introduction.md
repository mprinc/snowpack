## Overview

### What is Snowpack?

**Snowpack is a modern, lightweight toolchain for faster web development.** <span class='important'>Traditional JavaScript build tools like webpack and Parcel need to rebuild & rebundle entire chunks of your application every time you save a single file</span>. This rebundling step introduces <span class='definition'>lag</span> between hitting save on your changes and seeing them reflected in the browser.

<span class='important'>Snowpack serves your application **unbundled during development.**</span>  Every file only needs to be built once and then is <span class='comment' data-comment='Hm, in code they write that some code is not  possible to cache, and it hit my TS code I think'>cached forever</span>. When a file changes, Snowpack r<span class='important'>ebuilds that single file</span>. There's no time wasted re-bundling every change, just instant updates in the browser (made even faster via [Hot-Module Replacement (HMR)](#hot-module-replacement)). You can read more about this approach in our [Snowpack 2.0 Release Post.](/posts/2020-05-26-snowpack-2-0-release/) 

Snowpack's <span class='definition'>**unbundled development** </span>still supports the same <span class='definition'>**bundled builds**</span> that you're used to for production. When you go to <span class='definition'>build</span> your application for production, you canÂ plug in your favorite bundler via an official Snowpack plugin for Webpack or Rollup (coming soon). <span class='important'>With Snowpack already handling your build, there's no complex bundler config required</span>.

**Snowpack gets you the best of both worlds:** fast, unbundled development with optimized performance in your bundled production builds.

### Browser Support

**Snowpack builds your site for both modern and legacy browsers. Even IE11 is supported.** You can control and customize this behavior with the ["browserlist" package.json property](https://css-tricks.com/browserlist-good-idea/). 

The only requirement is that *during development* you use a [modern browser](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module). Any recent release of Firefox, Chrome, or Edge will do. This is required to support the modern, <span class='definition'>bundle-free ESM imports</span> that load your application in the browser.
